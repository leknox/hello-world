# hello-world
I'm creating this repository as an exercise while I'm learning to use github. 
I will be posting a simple ~70-line Jupyter notebook to it with a completed exercise 
in it I was using to re-learn programming. I will be taking this notebook to our
local code review in two weeks to learn how it might be written better.
